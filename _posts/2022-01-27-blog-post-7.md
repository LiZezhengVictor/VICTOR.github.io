Paper: [**Residual D2NN training diffractive deep neural networks via learnable light shortcuts**](https://opg.optica.org/ol/abstract.cfm?uri=ol-45-10-2688)

Continuing with the previous article, we continue to introduce a diffractive neural network.
In the field of deep learning, Kaiming He's residual neural network resnet is known to everyone. So, can this structure be applied to diffraction neural networks? This is the idea proposed in this paper.
