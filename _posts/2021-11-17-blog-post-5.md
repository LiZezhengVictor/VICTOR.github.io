Paper: [**In situ optical backpropagation training of diffractive optical neural networks**](https://opg.optica.org/prj/fulltext.cfm?uri=prj-8-6-940&id=432129)

This is a method of training diffractive neural networks extended from the previous article ***All-optical machine learning using diffractive deep neural networks***, which is very clever.
