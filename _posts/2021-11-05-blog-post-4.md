Paper: [**All-optical machine learning using diffractive deep neural networks**](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aat8084)

In this paper, the authors propose an all-optical diffractive neural network (D2NN) that is physically formed from multiple layers of diffractive surfaces, similar to the layers of a traditional neural network, that work together to optically  accomplish some visual tasks.
