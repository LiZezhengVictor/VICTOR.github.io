Paper: [**Fourier-space Diffractive Deep Neural Network**](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.123.023901)

Continue with the last note and continue to introduce other aspects of diffractive neural networks. This paper converts optical information into the Fourier domain of processing. This method can complete more complex computer vision tasks (such as segmentation), and it has also been confirmed that the Fourier diffraction neural network has higher accuracy and stability on some tasks than before.
